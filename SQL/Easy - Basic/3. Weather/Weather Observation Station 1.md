[Weather Observation Station 1 | HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-1/problem?isFullScreen=true)

Query a list of **CITY** and **STATE** from the **STATION** table.  
The **STATION** table is described as follows:
![[Pasted image 20240603121135.png]]
where **LAT_N** is the northern latitude and **LONG_W** is the western longitude.

THE QUERY:
```SQL

SELECT CITY, STATE FROM STATION;
```
EXPLANATION:
- So this right here is something, we're selecting multiple things in a single `SELECT` query, which is done by using `','` a comma(ignore the quotes, they're not a part of it!).
- Rest is pretty standard!
