# Welcome, Fellow Learners ðŸŽ‰

This directory will hold problems from SQL-HackerRank and their solutions(or at least my solutions!ðŸ˜…)
If you find any problems with photos not being shown or such don't worry, they're the same from problem statements. You can view them from there.

# Important Advise
If you'd like, use the `Obsidian` note application in case you download these notes, since I used the same application to make it, It's highly compatible with that.

I'll see to it that these stay relevant and updated if the platform makes any changes with problems and such!
